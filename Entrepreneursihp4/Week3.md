# Venture capital and the Financing of Innovation
venture cpital is just as one from of startup financing.
- Commercial banks
- angel investors
- Crowdfunding
- Government grants
- Entrepreneurial bootstrapping

## Financing innovation: two examples
- apple: 20% by VC
- Genetech: 21% by VC

## VCs help overcome information problems: before and after signing
- before contract is signed: hidden infromation
1. VC & entrepreneur provide different information
- after contract has been signed: hidden action
1. VC cannot perfectly observe the entrepreneur's effort.

Usually, you have to show the proof of concept in the beginning, and get another round of financing.

## What do venture capitalists do?
- raise money for their funds
- source investment opportunities
- perform due diligence on potential investees
- price and structure investments
- monitor and add 'extra'-financial value to portfolio firms (via coporate governance
- Exit the investment

## U.S. VC $M amount invested (source: PwC MoneyTree/NVCA) 
$60 M dollars.

## U.S. VC investment performance
- For 22,004 startups founded by U.S. VC between 1987-2008, the
average exit value was $5.8M, but ~75% of the investments
resulted in zero value to venture capitalists.
– R.E. Hall and S.E. Woodward, “The burden of non-diversifiable risk of
entrepreneurship,” American Economic Review, 2010

## What do entrepreneurs pay for VC affiliation?
-Sample of startups at the Series A round of VC financing, each
with multiple offers for financing; unit of analysis is a funding offer
- Study two outcomes: likelihood an offer is accepted & the
price/unit equity sold (relative to startups’ most generous financial
offer).
- Control for a wide spectrum of firm and investor characteristics;
key explanatory variables: measures of VC reputation and
experience
- Results: aggregate money left on the table as a % accepted
valuation offers: 12.5%; high reputation VCs 3x more likely to
have their offers accepted & acquire startup equity at 10-14%
- DH. Hsu, Journal of Finance (2004), Vol. 59, pp. 1805-1844

## Further research findings about entrepreneurial investors
• VCs, especially more reputable VCs:
– accelerate startup professionalization (e.g., business
development, human resource management)
– innovation/successful exit (based on a study examining the
exogenous introduction of direct airline flights between VCs
and their existing portfolio companies)

# Crowdfunding as a new way of funding
- as costs of startups fall, new funding mechanisms
## Four kinds of crowdfunding
- equity: raising money and giving a percentage of your company away over the internet
- peer-to-peer lending
- reward-based: kickstarter or indiegogo. raising money and in return for the money, you give reward or a product to them.
- patronage/charit

## Corwdfunding as a source of innovation & companies
- oculus
- SCio

## What does crowdfunding do for you?
1. develop a customer base
2. bring attention to my project
3. get original view on the demand for my project...

## Crowdfunding is how communities support innovation
1. bronycon: documentary
2. where the redo fox lies
3.
4. 
people most constributed 1 documentary, and raised $300,000.

## The crowd looks for quality, just like investors do
- 2004, the widsom of crowds by James surowieck
Is crowd in funding wise or mad?

## How do crowds do in filling the job of experts? (with Ramana Nanda, HBS)
1. Experts
- 30 professionals who judge theater grants
for the NEA and other national
competitions.
- Answered questions derived from NEA
criteria about the audience, artistic merit,
and feasibility of project pitches
- Judged Kickstarter theater projects
selected using stratified sampling

2. Kickstarter Backers
- 120 Kickstarter projects in theater (30
failures, 30 partial failures, 30 successes,
30 large successes)
- Surveyed the projects as well to get
outcomes

## The crowd and experts seem to agree
- Crowd and Experts agree around
60% of the time, with more
successful projects getting more
agreement.
- 75% of the time where there is a
disagreement, it is the crowd funding
something the experts didn’t.

## What happens in the long term
- experts & crowd, increase commercial hit and success
- crowd only, failure incrase, but artistic hit

## More evidence from tech, games & design
1. Signs of Quality
- Endorsements
- Team with experience
- Prototypes
- Detailed plans
- No spelling errors
- Frequent updates

2. Signal other than quality
- Memes (cats, bacon, etc) none
- In-group identity (geek, etc) none  
- Pop culture (Star Wars, etc) none

## How to do it
- Success happens by small margins, failure by large margins
- Large goal = lower chances of success, more benefits if you succeed, longer delays

## Tips for crowdfunding 1
Remember the value of community!
1. Number 1 & 2 reason listed for failure of campaigns in my survey: the target
audience was not well understood and marketing was not adequate
2. To take an average project in the Film category:
– 10 Facebook friends = 9% chance of succeeding
– 100 friends = 20% chance of success
– 1000 friends = 40% chance
3. Large goal = lower chances of success, more benefits if you succeed, longer
delays

## Tips for getting the most out of crowdfunding
- People spend 30 hours/week working on campaign, before,
during and after
- 2/3 are done with teams
- High quality videos matter
- Community engagement matters
- Hiring outside consultants has limited value

## For Now, Wait and See for Equity Crowdfunding
1. 1,000 platforms lined up to compete
2. Expect that qualified investors will still do most investing through
2016
3. Expect impact on specific areas
– Real estate
– Startup funding

## additional funding after crowdfunding
- raised more than goal
- featured by Kickstarter
- having right background
- haing outside endorsements
- complete financial plan
- a lot of facebook friends
- initial business plan
those factors positively contribute to additional funding after crowdfunding.

# Debt financing
Equity makes the investor an owner of the business – for better or worse.
1. Debt is an obligation to return principal and interest.
2. Debt is usually senior to equity – it is paid back before equity.
3. Debt is often secured by assets – the collateral.
4. Examples:
• Trade debt (i.e., payables due suppliers).
• Credit card balance.
• Equipment financing (e.g., leases for machines).
• Bank line of credit.
• Government loans.
• (Convertible notes from investors.)

## Issues with Debt
• If things go well, generally less costly to founders than equity.
• Typically have to pay interest from cash flow, which will be difficult for most
start-ups.
• Typically requires personal guarantees of management team, so
unattractive to those with significant personal assets.
• If genuinely secured by valuable assets (e.g., receivables, inventory,
equipment) then may be a good alternative to equity financing during
growth phase.
- good way to own control of the company

## Financing Working Capital with Debt
1. Working capital is the cash you need to operate the business,
even when it is profitable.
– Cash tied up in inventory.
– Receivables you are waiting for customers to pay.
2. Banks will often provide a line of credit collateralized by
receivables and inventory.
– Loan covenants specify the ratio of debt to collateral. For
instance, the bank may be willing to lend up to 70 percent of
the value of your receivables and inventory.
– Often still requires a personal guarantee.
3. Specialized financial institutions may factor receivables from your
financially solid customers.
– Expensive! Sometimes as high as 24% annual interest.

## A special kind of debt – the convertible note
• Used as a quick, inexpensive way to raise a (relatively) small
amount of capital without setting a valuation. In most respects
more like equity financing than typical debt financing.
• Investor puts in seed capital as a loan – e.g., 100,000 USD.
• Loan converts to equity when and if an institutional investor (e.g.,
a VC) provides more capital – e.g., 1 million USD.
• Usually converts at a discount (e.g., 20 percent) and usually has
a “cap” of some amount (e.g., 4 million USD pre-money
valuation).

## SVB

# Burn Rate
1. Net negative cash flow per unit time.
2. Typically expressed as monthly value.
- “What’s your burn rate?”

## Fume Date and Runway
How much cash do you have on hand?
1. Cash-on-hand / burn-rate is your runway.
2. Your fume date is the date at which you have no remaining runway

# Breakeven analysis
Two distinct uses of this expression:
1. Breakeven Time (aka Payback Time). How much calendar time would be
required for an investment to be recovered from positive cash flow.
2. Breakeven Quantity. How many “units” (i.e., transactions, quanitity of
product, orders, customers) must we experience per unit time in order to
cover our fixed costs? 

## Breakeven Time / Payback Time
- Most commonly used as a quick way to think about a lump-sum investment.
- For instance, What is the breakeven time for the conversion of our delivery trucks to use compressed natural gas instead of gasoline?

## Financial Sustainability – making and selling something
Q(p-c) > F
- Q: quantity sold per unit time 	 (e.g.,	30,000	openers/year)
- p: price per	unit	(e.g.,	25.00	USD/opener)
- c: cost per	unit	(e.g.,	13.44	USD/opener)
- F: fixed costs to	operate	the	business	 per	unit	 time	 (e.g.,	300,000	USD/year)
rent,	advertising,	salaries,	 etc.
Q	=	300,000	/	(25.00	– 13.44)	
=	25,952	units/year	(2,163	units/month)

## Breakeven for Recurring Services (e.g. SaaS)
monthly recurring revenue > fixed costs

## Issues
1. Breakeven assumes a fixed level of spending (e.g. payroll, advertising, rent).
2. But, these costs are not really fixed – they typically vary somewhat depending
on the overall scale of the business.
3. So, breakeven calculations are often framed as
“If we were this size of an organization, how many units would we have to sell
a month to breakeven?”
4. Sometimes useful to do this analysis for the “minimum efficient scale” of the
business.
5. Helps to test intuition about how feasible a business concept is
