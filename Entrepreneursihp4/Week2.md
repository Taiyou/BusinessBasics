# Equity financing: valuation
- value
1. defined by the price of a transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller, usually an investor and a company
2. In any specific case, value is determined through negotiation.
3. Ideally that negotiated value reflects the fundamental financial value of the company based on the long-term expected cash flows.

## Why do you need to value the business?
1. you do not need to establish a value for the business unless you are going to sell a fraction of the company to another party.
2. In that case, the buyer and seller have to agree on a price. What fraction of the company does the investment purchase?

## it is everyone's interest to etimate value accurately!
- if too high, your investor won't make a good return. not fair nor good for your reputation
- if too low, not good for your motivation and team.

## Some approaches
1. value of the inputs
2. comparable companies and transactions
3. discounting for time and risk from some estimated future value
4. multiple of earnings 

## 1. valuation based on the value of the inputs
- 6 months of sweat by two recent colledge graduates (100,000 USD)
- cash for initial expenses (25,000 USD)
- commitment of two team members to work the next 6 months with no pay - weat equity (100,000 USD)
- the idea itself intellectual property (25,000 USD)
- could logically argue the business is worth 250,000 USD.
- investors will pay 25,000 USD owning 11% of the company 

## 2. valueation based on comparable deals
- 

## 3. discounting for time and risk based on some future outcome
- PWERM - probability weighted expected return method
1. define several outcome scenarios for some future date.
2. estimate the probabilities of those ecenarios
3. calculate a risk-adjusted future value
4. discount that value to the present using the investor's opporunity cost of capital

## 4. value vased on earnings
1. for companies with positive cash flow and several years of operating history, can base valueation on earnings.
2. usually use EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization)
3. a multiple is applied EBITDA, but could be 5x or 50x depending on the sector and ancitipated growth rate.
4. publicaly traded companies in the U.S. are valued at an average of about 15x EBITDA in 2016, but for instance Amazon is valued at 400x EBITDA.

## kick the valuation question down the road
1. convertible notes
2. investor puts in seed capital as a loan
3. loan converts to equity when and if an institutional ivector provides more capital
4. usually converts at a discount and usually has a cap of some amount.
