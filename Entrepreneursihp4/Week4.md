# Executive Summary and Pitch Desk 
- common area of confusion when trying to raise funding is the difference between the Eecutive summary and the pitch deck
- want to create a clear division between these two pieces of information and how to best ues them

## important vabeat...
- executive summaries and pitch are not s tatic
- they also change based on who are you talking to
- example
- the information is different if you are speaking to an industry expert as opposed to someone not faimliar with the problem you are trying to solve

## goals for your pitch deck
- your Decks are not meant to raise money
- you decks are the way to have the next set of conversations
- having multiple conversations, building understanding and relationships lead to raising money

## pitch deck: the problem
- investors and entrepreneurs are by nature problem solvers and opportunity seekers
- if you can actually convince your audience that they also recognize the gap you are trying to address you are starting the right track

- but if you aren't solving some problem in the world, you are going to have a long uphill climb with you business.
- this section talks about the problem:
1. what is it?
2. who has it?
3. how big is it?
4. how widespread is it?
5. what the cost associated?

## value proposition (VP)
- now tha tpeople understand the problem... what are you offering?
- The value proposition is a quick sentence (really not more than 2 of the vlaue that you provide
- key points:
1. keep it short and simple
2. ensure that it's clear why the VP makes sense
3. you can also use analogies that help people to understand quickly.

## target market and opportunity
- this is where you start to talk size in terms of revenue a profit
1. who is the ideal customer?
2. how many of them are there?
3. what is the total addressable market size?
4. how do you position your company?
- really good to inclue comparable data
1. comparable meaning: how much is currently spent in that market
- for target market, be specific as possible
1. for example, does a business target all mnd 30 living in urban areas.
en, but rather a business would target mean between 25 a
2. although it might be tempting to define your as market extremely large, investors will want to see a reachable market.

## solution 
- now that you've explained the problem, the VP, and the high levelopportunity size and target market, you finally get to describing your solution.
- good practices
1. describe cutomers using your product
2. explain the benefits to the customers as well
3. be carefull
- most entrepreneurs are super 'product-focused', but rather they should be customer and customers' problem focused
4. use pictures and stories; showing is very powerful.

## Competiion
1. every business has competition in one form or another
- even if you are doing something very new
2. descirbe the competitive landscape and how you fit in 
- explain how you are different  - good to put this into the buckets 'competitors' and 'alternatives'
3. explain your advantages
4. the more you can break down the competitors into what they do and dont the easier it is to explain how you are different
5. explain why the things you do differently  = market penetration and growth

## Revenue model
1. time to talk how  you make money
2. common thing to address
- what do you charge?
- what frequency?
- who pays the bills?
- you can also re-reference competitive landscape.
 

## traction and roadmap
1. traction:
- if you have early adopters it is great to mention!
- investors love to see proof of concept
2. roadmap:
- what are your milestones? every ining product or offering has a v1 or v2
- what milestones have you hit so far?

## marketing, sales, retention
1. important to explain how you will capture customers and then keep them
- how are you planning on getting customers attention?
- what does the sales process look like? how long does it take?
2. if you have traction already, it's great to show how that process worked, why it will continue to work, and how it mihgt improve over time
3. finding and winning customers it the ultimate goal, you have to convince investors you cand do this.

## team
1. very important section
2. ultimately given that startsups are so risky, investors really invest in people
- why are you and your team the right people?
- what experience do you have that is relevant? or unique?
3. highlight the key team members, their backgrounds, and ther expertise
4. if you dont have a complete team yet don't worry - just identify the key positions that you need to be filled and why

## financials
- great to translate all the prior sections into what that means in terms of money
- sales forecast, profit and loss statement, and cash flow forecast
- dont make it an in-depth spreadsheed that is really complex
- limit things to charts, total customers, total expenses, profit, etc.
- key point:
 1. be prepared to discuss underlying assumptions
 2. be realistic: investors see hundreds of these and know how to pull them apart.
 
 ## investment and use of funds.
 - finally, it's time to highlight what you need to take the company to the next level
 - remember you are not asking for money directly. you are having a conversation and being transparent about how much you need to go forward
 - equally as important as how much yo uneed it the answer to the questions what will you do with the money?
 1. explain how you plan to use the money
 2. how does it help you achieve your business goal.
 - if you already have investors - ask them why they chose to invest.
 
 ## other potential information
 - exit strategy
 - partnerships
 - demo/screenshots
 1. technical documentation
 2. detailed models
 
 ## making the pitch successful
 - keep it simple - be simple and leave room for questions
 - skipp the bullets
 - use large fonts and limit words per slide
 - use images when possible
 - send your deck as a .pdf
 - must tell a story, get your audience excited.
 
 ## executive summary
 - 2 or 3 page overview of your business in .pdf format sharable
 - not graphical - paragraph in nature and often initial connection
 - focus on the core of the business
 - purpose is to get a longer meeting
 
 ## the opening sentence
 - lead with a truly inspirational / compelling / powerful statement
 1. getreaders engaged fast 
 2. early sentences est the entire tone
 
 - best practices:
 1. concise and explains unique solution to a big problem
 2. direct, specific, crisp language - not abstract and conceptual
 3. name dropping works if you can back it up
 - well known advisorsh
 - famouse people truly engaed on your board
 
 ## your competitive advantage
 - you have competition, dont say you do not have any
 1. at a minimum, you complete with the current way of doing business.
 2. soft reasons whey no on does
 - usually a competitor exists: direct or substitute
 3. build a statement around your sustainable competitive advantage
 - firs mover advantage doesnt count
 4. articulate unique benefits and advantages that you have
 - make this point in one or two sentences.
 
 ## model
 - the executive summary is short and in written form, it's not where you explain/paste your entire .xls model
 - but, need to explain how you will drive revenue and what your costs are 
 - revenue
 1. where does revenues come from? from whom?
 2. why is your business scalable and efficient?
 3. what are the critical metrics?
 4. what revenue levels will you reach within three to five years?
 - cost:
 1. what are the major cost drivers and how can they be managed?
 2. how can you scale costs across multiple opporunities to reduce them?
 
 ## the team
 - very important to explain the peple behind the idea/business
 - do's and dont's
 
1. avoid saying things like: we have 100 yrs of combined expertise in solar
2. do say our lead solar scientist was the CTO at XYZ market leader
3. dont' go into detail on each founder's resume
4. do explain why the tem's background fits
5. dont' drop names of people/companies that you can't back up
6. do state names of relevant people or companies that you can connect with investors to provide as references.

  ## promise
  - the main point: I will make you a lot of money
  - your financial projections need to show it that If i grow to X size, you Y% is worth Z dollars.
  1. obviously Z dollars should be an interesting number
  - the numbers MUST be believable
  1. in your projections make sure your assumptions are resonable and underpinned
  2. sanity check number: i.e. if you say only need 10,000 customers yr 1
  3. dont say you only have 1 sales person starting mid-year 
 
 ## ask
 - the ask is about being clear on what h are looking for in terms of money
 - generally this is the minimum equity you need to sell to get to the next milestone
 - if you expect to raise another round of financing later, make that clear, and if possible stat
 e the amount.
 
 ## key points
 - 6-8 paragraps
 - purposeful
 
# Pro Forma Financial Statements
• Pro forma (Latin for "as a matter of form”) means a forecast of future
financial statements for your business prepared according to typical
accounting conventions.
• Analysis is generally done by month, for 36 months.
• The three standard statements: income statement, cash flow statement,
balance sheet.
• Usually supported by a more detailed budget for the next 12 months.
• What will you spend over the next 12 months?
• Informs the use of proceeds from investment.


## financial statement
- income statement
- cash flow statement
- balance sheet

## Questions Answered by Pro Forma Financial Statements
1. What do I believe this business could look like financially in the future?
• And therefore what might it be worth?
2. What is the relationship between my key performance indicators (the
managerial parameters) and financial performance?
3. How much cash do I need for working capital and for losses I sustain
prior to breaking even?
4. Is my operating plan internally consistent and financially feasible?

## EBITDA	=	
earnings	before	interest,	taxes,	
depreciation,	and	amortization
Often	used	for	valuation	calculations	
for	more	mature	companies.

## Use a Managerial Model to Drive the Numbers
- Every business has different revenue and cost drivers, so create those that make your plan easiest to understand.

## Which Scenario Do you show?
- Realistic plan, conservative plan, or optimistic plan?
- In my 28 ventures, I've seen 3 expected the plan significantly.
- As a matter of practice most entrepreneurs show the 80-90th percentile scenario before there is significant revenue.
1. as a company matures, operating plans and budgets tend to become more realistic.
2. Not ideal, but is the reality of much of current behaavior...
3. Generally bad form to assert "these are "Conservative assumptions" They almost never are!

## Some Best Practices
- Build your model using key revenue and cost drivers (and othe rparameters) so your assumptions are clear.
- start with the income statement and use that to drive the cash flow statement and balance sheet.
- use detailed worksheets to drive summary sheets.
- model monthly, typically for 36 months

## Practical Advice
- You need to know some accounting. At a minimum, take an on-line course
- Start by building your own monthly income statement using a spreadsheet, and based on your key revenue and cost drivers.
- But, getting the Cash flow statement and Balance Sheet to link properly can be tricky.
- Engage a partner or consultant show is good with spreadsheets, if you are not.
- Free Excel templates 
- Paid services such as may also be useful.

# Entrepreneurial Exit
## What is an entrepreneurial exit & why is it important?
- forms of entrepreneurial liquidty
- Importance: shareholder liquidity; possible strategic effects

## Acquisitions / buyouts
- Pros: organizational synergies; faster resource acquisition
relative to organic development; shareholder liquidity (range of
possible terms, however)
- Cons: possible loss of control

## Public offerings
- Pros: visibility/credentialing; currency for acquisitions; shareholder liquidity
- Cons: hard to “time” the market (no objective threshold for a public offering); costs (direct and indirect)

## Public offerings
- “In retrospect, Mr. Hastings [the founder of Netflix] wishes he had
waited longer to go public ... ‘In hindsight, what triggered Amazon
and Blockbuster to compete with us is they could see how
profitable we were and how fast we were growing.’” – New York
Times, 2/22/05 p. G8
- “Ultimately, the biggest pressure to go public may be from
Google's employees. ...for many engineers and executives who
have earned stock options in the last few years, a public offering
is all that stands between them and a sports car, a beach house
or a year in Tibet.” – New York Times, 4/26/04

## The U.S. public offering process
- Underwriters (usually a syndicate, with a lead) is selected
- Lead underwriter duties: market the offering (conducts due
diligence, prepare marketing materials for the “road show”,
prepares a preliminary prospectus and regulatory filings);
determine the offering size and allocate shares to investors; price
the offering (“underpricing” is common); and after the IPO
monitors the price and possibly offer price support 

## Research: “Entrepreneurial Exits and Innovation”
- Research question: what is the relationship between
entrepreneurial exit modes and innovation outcomes?
- “Counterfactuals” often difficult to establish (e.g., what if a given
company would have gone public rather than been acquired?)
- Going public requires public disclosures and projects are
compared to expectations; both may affect innovation outcomes.
- Longitudinal dataset of ~400 biotechnology firms, some
completing an IPO or M&A; others “nearly” completing those
liquidity events; innovation measured through patents.
- Innovation patterns: private ownership > M&A > public ownership
