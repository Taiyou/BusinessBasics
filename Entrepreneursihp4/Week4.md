# Executive Summary and Pitch Desk 
- common area of confusion when trying to raise funding is the difference between the Eecutive summary and the pitch deck
- want to create a clear division between these two pieces of information and how to best ues them
## important vabeat...
- executive summaries and pitch are not s tatic
- they also change based on who are you talking to
- example
- the information is different if you are speaking to an industry expert as opposed to someone not faimliar with the problem you are trying to solve
## goals for your pitch deck
- your Decks are not meant to raise money
- you decks are the way to have the next set of conversations
- having multiple conversations, building understanding and relationships lead to raising money
## pitch deck: the problem
- investors and entrepreneurs are by nature problem solvers and opportunity seekers
- if you can actually convince your audience that they also recognize the gap you are trying to address you are starting the right track

- but if you aren't solving some problem in the world, you are going to have a long uphill climb with you business.
- this section talks about the problem:
1. what is it?
2. who has it?
3. how big is it?
4. how widespread is it?
5. what the cost associated?

## value proposition (VP)
- now tha tpeople understand the problem... what are you offering?
- The value proposition is a quick sentence (really not more than 2 of the vlaue that you provide
- key points:
1. keep it short and simple
2. ensure that it's clear why the VP makes sense
3. you can also use analogies that help people to understand quickly.

## target market and opportunity
- this is where you start to talk size in terms of revenue a profit
1. who is the ideal customer?
2. how many of them are there?
3. what is the total addressable market size?
4. how do you position your company?
- really good to inclue comparable data
1. comparable meaning: how much is currently spent in that market
- for target market, be specific as possible
1. for example, does a business target all mnd 30 living in urban areas.
en, but rather a business would target mean between 25 a
2. although it might be tempting to define your as market extremely large, investors will want to see a reachable market.

## solution 
- now that you've explained the problem, the VP, and the high levelopportunity size and target market, you finally get to describing your solution.
- good practices
1. describe cutomers using your product
2. explain the benefits to the customers as well
3. be carefull
- most entrepreneurs are super 'product-focused', but rather they should be customer and customers' problem focused
4. use pictures and stories; showing is very powerful.

## Competiion
1. every business has competition in one form or another
- even if you are doing something very new
2. descirbe the competitive landscape and how you fit in 
- explain how you are different  - good to put this into the buckets 'competitors' and 'alternatives'
3. explain your advantages
4. the more you can break down the competitors into what they do and dont the easier it is to explain how you are different
5. explain why the things you do differently  = market penetration and growth

## Revenue model
1. time to talk how  you make money
2. common thing to address
- what do you charge?
- what frequency?
- who pays the bills?
- you can also re-reference competitive landscape.
 

## traction and roadmap
1. traction:
- if you have early adopters it is great to mention!
- investors love to see proof of concept
2. roadmap:
- what are your milestones? every ining product or offering has a v1 or v2
- what milestones have you hit so far?

## marketing, sales, retention
1. important to explain how you will capture customers and then keep them
- how are you planning on getting customers attention?
- what does the sales process look like? how long does it take?
2. if you have traction already, it's great to show how that process worked, why it will continue to work, and how it mihgt improve over time
3. finding and winning customers it the ultimate goal, you have to convince investors you cand do this.

## team
1. very important section
2. ultimately given that startsups are so risky, investors really invest in people
- why are you and your team the right people?
- what experience do you have that is relevant? or unique?
3. highlight the key team members, their backgrounds, and ther expertise
4. if you dont have a complete team yet don't worry - just identify the key positions that you need to be filled and why

## financials
- great to translate all the prior sections into what that means in terms of money
- sales forecast, profit and loss statement, and cash flow forecast
- dont make it an in-depth spreadsheed that is really complex
- limit things to charts, total customers, total expenses, profit, etc.
- key point:
 1. be prepared to discuss underlying assumptions
 2. be realistic: investors see hundreds of these and know how to pull them apart.
 
 ## investment and use of funds.
 - finally, it's time to highlight what you need to take the company to the next level
 - remember you are not asking for money directly. you are having a conversation and being transparent about how much you need to go forward
 - equally as important as how much yo uneed it the answer to the questions what will you do with the money?
 1. explain how you plan to use the money
 2. how does it help you achieve your business goal.
 - if you already have investors - ask them why they chose to invest.
