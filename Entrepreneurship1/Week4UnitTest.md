- Is one person talking
- Is about selling
- Answer: Depends on your audience

- Phase 1: talking, Phase 2: answering questions from listeners
Summary: 
- be aware of what you are talking about and who you are talking to.
- know what your audience knows.

# Q2. What is a common downside of convenience samples compared to other survey methods:
- They are expensive to collect
- It is difficult to generate enough interest for a large sample
- The sample group may not be representative of the population
- All answers are true
- Answer: The sample group may not be representative of the population
Survery key principles.
- survey should be done after interviews
- for convincing or analyzing
Finding a sample:
- convenience samples: school, friends, facebook
- purchased samples: google surveys
- Targeted ads: LinkedIn, Facebook, Adwords

# Q3. Which of the following is a best practice when developing survey questions?
- All answers are important factors to consider when developing survey questions
- Including demographic questions near the beginning of the survey
- Being careful with open-ended questions
- Only using Yes/No questions to qualify/sort groups
- Answer: All answers are important factors to consider when developing survey questions

General notes on question types.
- Consider demographic question at top
- Only use Yes/No to qualify
- Be careful with open-ended question
How do you know if you have good questions?
- Pretest:
Initially face-to-face, small sample
- Look for:
variance, comfort and understanding questions, missing options, annoyance, timing

# Q4. What is the best method to approach survey questions on pricing/features?
- Von Westendorp
- Open-ended questions 
- Conjoint analysis
- Pricing ladder
- Answer: Conjoint analysis

# Q5. What is the benefit of building prototypes?
- They communicate what you are doing to the marketplace
- They demonstrate that you can successfully implement the idea
- They can prove that your solution is technically feasible
- All answers are reasons for building prototypes
- Answer: All answers are reasons for building prototypes
Types of proto-types
- focused and comprehensive
Why build prototypes
- For you:
learn, solve problems, answer questions
- For others:
- 1. proof of your solution
- 2. proof of communication what you are doing
- 3. decomonstration of implementation

# Q6. Which of the following is a disadvantage associated with the ODM (“original design manufacturer”) approach?
- The outsourcing firm has nothing proprietary
- Outsourcing the design work is costly
- The outsourcing firm has little control over the end product
- The manufacturer does not have design expertise
- Answer: The outsourcing firm has nothing proprietary
Working with a supplier for prototypes
- Two basic approaches:
- 1. ODM
- 2. Factory producing to your proprietary design

Does your enterprise's advantage come from a unique, proprietary design?
- If yes, then you have to own your design.

# Q7. True or False? If your enterprise’s advantage comes from a unique, proprietary design, then it needs to own the design.
- Answer: True.

# Q8. What is one advantage of throwaway prototyping?
- Only the features that are well understood are built and tested
- It is fast and provides users a full sense of the system
- It requires less technical expertise
- All answers are true
- Answer:  It requires less technical expertise
Why bother prototyping?
- Serves 2 mainpurpuse.
- 1. To clarify user interface to user and/or developer
- 2. To clarify functionality supported
Benefits:
- reduce cost & time relative to building full product and iterating.
- Can involve other stakeholders such as non-engieerging founders into product discussions.
- Increase product quality by ensuring  UX & UI are clear before implementation
Types of prototypes:
- Trowaway prototyping
Create a model of the final system that user can evaluate.
Relatively fast method to prototype
- Evolutionary prototyping
Build only portions of the system, and prototype evoles to become the final product.

- Practical tips on prototyping:
- 1. gather requirements
- 2. develop initial protype that is static and low/medium fidelity
- 3. get initial feedback
- 4. develop interactive prototype of medium to high fidelity.
- 5. freeze design and proceed to development.

# Q9. What type of prototype would be a good candidate for the initial prototype?
- Interactive and medium/high fidelity
- Static and of low/medium fidelity
- Interactive and low/medium fidelity
- Static and of medium/high fidelity
- Answer: Static and of low/medium fidelity

# Q10. What is a characteristic of the “Wizard of Oz” approach to prototyping services?
- None of these are true
- Consumer is only presented with one part of the service
- Consumer is unaware of the back end operations
- Half of the consumers are given one treatment and the other half are given a different treatment
- Answer: Consumer is unaware of the back end operations
“Wizard of Oz” :
